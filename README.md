# Description
OrdinaryJukeBox is a music discord bot with a few features so far. It can play YouTube videos given a YouTube link as well as audio files. Unfortunately, it cannot queue YouTube songs, but it can queue audio files. To get the bot to play music, first use the "!connect" command to summon the bot into any channel. Then to play YouTube videos, enter the command, "!play [insert link]". If you have an audio file, use the same command, "!play" but attach the audio file. In both methods, you'll be prompted with a "Now playing... [title of song/audio file]." While listening to the music, you can use two commands, "!pause" and "!resume". Once the song is complete and no other song has been queued, the bot will disconnect on its own. However, the "!disconnect" command can be useful if halfway you no longer want to listen to the song and disconnect the bot. Thank you for reading and enjoying listening to your favorite tunes!
